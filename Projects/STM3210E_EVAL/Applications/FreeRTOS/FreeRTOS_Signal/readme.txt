@par Description

How to perform thread signaling using CMSIS RTOS API.

This example creates three threads with the same priority

Thread1 calls osSignalWait to wait for a signal that sets bit0 then toggles LED1

Thread2 calls osSignalWait to wait for a signal that sets bit1 and bit2 then toggles LED2

Thread3 performs the following actions:
  - calls osSetSignal to send a signal with bit0 to Thread1
  - delay for 500ms
  - calls osSetSignal to send a signal with bit1 and bit2 to Thread2
  - delay for 500ms
  
As a results LEDs 1 and 2 shows the following behaviour :
  - LED1 On, delay 500ms
  - LED2 On, delay 500ms
  - LED1 Off, delay 500ms
  - LED2 off, delay 500ms
  - loop-back

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application need to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@note The FreeRTOS heap size configTOTAL_HEAP_SIZE defined in FreeRTOSConfig.h is set accordingly to the 
      OS resources memory requirements of the application with +10% margin and rounded to the upper Kbyte boundary.

on STM32Cube with RTOS".

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F103xG devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STM3210E-EVAL RevD board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.


@par How to use it ?

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
