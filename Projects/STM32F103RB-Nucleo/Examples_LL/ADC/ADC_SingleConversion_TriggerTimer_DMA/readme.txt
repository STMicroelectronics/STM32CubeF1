@par Example Description

How to use an ADC peripheral to perform a single ADC conversion on a channel 
at each trigger event from a timer. Converted data is indefinitely transferred 
by DMA into a table (circular mode).
This example is based on the STM32F1xx ADC LL API.
The peripheral initialization is done using LL unitary service functions 
for optimization purposes (performance and size).

Example configuration:
ADC is configured to convert a single channel, in single conversion mode,
from HW trigger: timer peripheral.
DMA is configured to transfer conversion data in an array, in circular mode.
A timer is configured in time base and to generate TRGO events.

Example execution:
From the first press on User Button, the ADC performs 1 conversion of the selected
channel at each trig from timer.
DMA transfers conversion data to the array.
When DMA reaches the selected number of transfers,
DMA half transfer and transfer complete interruptions occurs.
Data array is updated indefinitely (DMA in circular mode).
LED2 is turned off at DMA half transfer and turned on at DMA transfer complete.

For debug: variables to monitor with debugger watch window:
 - "aADCxConvertedData": ADC group regular conversion data
 - "aADCxConvertedData_Voltage_mVolt": ADC conversion data computation to physical values (array of data)

Connection needed:
Use an external power supply, adjust supply voltage and connect it to analog input pin (cf pin below).

Other peripherals used:
  1 GPIO for User Button
  1 GPIO for LED2
  1 GPIO for analog input: PA.04 (Arduino connector CN8 pin A2, Morpho connector CN7 pin 32)
  DMA
  Timer
