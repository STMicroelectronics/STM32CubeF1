@par Example Description

Configuration of a timer to generate a positive pulse in 
Output Compare mode with a length of tPULSE and after a delay of tDELAY. This example 
is based on the STM32F1xx TIM LL API. The peripheral initialization uses 
LL unitary service functions for optimization purposes (performance and size).

The pulse is generated on OC1.

This example uses 2 timer instances:

  - TIM3 generates a positive pulse of 50 us after a delay of 50 us. User push-button
    is used to start TIM3 counter. 
                                              ___ 
                                             |   |
    User push-button ________________________|   |________________________________
                                                            ___________
                                                           |           |
    OC1              ______________________________________|           |________
    (TIM3_CH1)                                <---50 us---><---50 us--->
                                                |            |_ uwMeasuredPulseLength
                                                |_ uwMeasuredDelay

  TIM3_CH1 delay and pulse length are measured every time a pulse is generated. 
  Both can be observed through the debugger by monitoring the variables uwMeasuredDelay and
  uwMeasuredPulseLength respectively.

  - TIM2 generates a positive pulse of 3 s after a delay of 2 s. TIM2 counter start
    is controlled through the slave mode controller. TI2FP2 signals is selected as
    trigger input meaning that TIM2 counter starts when a rising edge is detected on
    TI2FP2. The TIM2 output channel is mapped on the pin PA.00.
                                  ___
                                 |   |
    TI2 _________________________|   |_________________________________________
    (TIM2_CH2)
                                               ___________________________
                                              |                           |
    OC1 ______________________________________|                           |____
    (TIM2_CH1)                   <-----2s-----><----------3 s------------->
   


Both TIM3 and TIM2 are configured to generate a single pulse (timer counter 
stops automatically at the next update event (UEV).

Connecting TIM3 OC1 to TIM2 TI2 allows to trigger TIM2 counter by pressing
the User push-button.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F103xB devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STM32F103RB-Nucleo board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

  - STM32F103RB-Nucleo Set-up:
      - TIM3_CH1  PA.06: connected to pin 5 of CN5 connector  
      - TIM2_CH1  PA.00: connected to pin 1 of CN8 connector 
      - TIM2_CH2  PA.01: connected to pin 2 of CN8 connector 

@par How to use it ?
