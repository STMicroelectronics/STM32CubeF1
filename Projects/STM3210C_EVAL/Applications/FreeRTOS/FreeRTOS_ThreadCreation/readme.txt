@par Description

How to implement thread creation using CMSIS RTOS API. 

This example creates two threads with the same priority, which execute in 
a periodic cycle of 15 seconds. 

In the first 5 seconds, the thread 1 toggles LED1 each 200 ms and the 
thread 2 toggles LED2 each 500 ms.
In the following 5 seconds, the thread 1 suspends itself and the thread 2
continue toggling LED2.
In the last 5 seconds, the thread 2 resumes execution of thread 1 then 
suspends itself, the thread 1 toggles the LED1 each 500 ms.    

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate
      delay (in milliseconds) based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This
      implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from a peripheral ISR process, then 
      the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application need to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@note The FreeRTOS heap size configTOTAL_HEAP_SIZE defined in FreeRTOSConfig.h is set accordingly to the 
      OS resources memory requirements of the application with +10% margin and rounded to the upper Kbyte boundary.

on STM32Cube with RTOS".

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F107xC devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STM3210C-EVAL RevC board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.
    


@par How to use it ?

In order to make the program work, you must do the following:
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
